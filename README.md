Guthib
Guthib is an intelligent platform that connects developers with organizations by matching them to relevant issues based on their skills, preferences, and activity. It makes open-source collaboration smarter, faster, and more personalized.

Overview
Guthib operates through two main portals — one for developers and one for organizations. Developers can create detailed profiles with their GitHub links, resumes, and issue preferences, while organizations can efficiently assign issues to the most suitable contributors.

The platform offers two subscription tiers:

Free Plan: Access to general issues and organizations.

Premium Plan: Exclusive access to premium organizations, available through subscription or earned via consistent GitHub activity.

Guthib also provides a mobile app for handy management, enabling users and organizations to track issues, updates, and progress seamlessly on the go.

Automated contributor verification through GitHub activity

Secure authentication using Auth0

Reliable data management with MongoDB

Integrated testing with Qyrus API for platform stability

Agentic Gemini API for maintaining and analyzing developer and organization identities

Challenges Faced
During large-scale testing, API timeout issues occurred with GitHub and Gemini. These were resolved using optimized request batching, async management, and scalable API handling strategies.

Business Model
Guthib follows a freemium model with subscription-based revenue from organizations and developers. Premium users access advanced analytics, exclusive projects, and verified contributor networks.

Guthib simplifies how organizations find skilled contributors and how developers connect with meaningful work. With AI-powered matching, a mobile app for seamless access, and smart workload management, it bridges the gap between talent and opportunity — redefining open-source collaboration.
